I am a virtual assistant who has been working behind the scenes for the past 9 years. I work with coaches, internet marketers, speakers etc. to help them build their businesses. I free up their time so that they can do what they do best, while I do what I do best, which is ensuring the back end of their business runs smoothly and efficiently.

I love strategizing with my clients and showing them how to rock their businesses to the core! I am always ready for new challenges and meet them head-on.
